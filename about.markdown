Hi! I’m Ben Reubenstein. I’ve had the distinct privilege of growing up in the analog to digital transition (1981 to present) watching a huge machine on my desk fit into my pocket.

Over that time I’ve been a Software Engineer, a CTO, a Founder, and a CEO. I was [lucky](https://www.profgalloway.com/third-base) enough to have a successful exit. Currently I’m running [XCR Ventures, LLC](https://www.xcrventures.com) which invests in early stage companies and a partner in Colorado Active Growth Ventures.

So what’s with the tagline from? Only one of the greatest movies ever made, [Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_in_the_Hall:_Brain_Candy).

Want to talk? Book a time during my [office hours](https://calendly.com/benreu/30min).
