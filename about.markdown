  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hi! I’m Ben Reubenstein. I’ve had the distinct privilege of growing up in the analog to digital transition (1981 to present) watching a huge machine on my desk fit into my pocket. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over that time I’ve been a Software Engineer, a CTO, a Founder, and a CEO. I was <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/third-base">lucky</a> enough to have a successful exit. Currently I’m running <a href="https://www.xcrventures.com">XCR Ventures, LLC</a> which invests in early stage companies and a partner in Colorado Active Growth Ventures. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So what’s with the tagline from? Only one of the greatest movies ever made, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_in_the_Hall:_Brain_Candy">Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy</a>. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Want to talk? Book a time during my <a href="https://calendly.com/benreu/30min">office hours</a>.</p>
