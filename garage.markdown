# Garage Door Incident

On February 22, 2023 our garage door did not fully open. The garage stopped message was sent to the myQ app, however NO warning sound or light flashing was issued by the system. The driver fully waited for motor to stop before starting the vehicle. The below videos show the incident and there are screenshots of the applications. The referred technician could not see any obvious issue with the unit or setup that would have caused it to not function correctly. He serviced the door for $100. We opted to not replace the door at this time. Car damage was over $2000 and will likely raise our insurance rates.
