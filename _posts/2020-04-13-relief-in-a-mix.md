I busted out my [old MiniDisc player](https://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-R50.html) yesterday. My goal was to rip some of the live shows I recorded on it in the late 90s and early 00s. I managed to dump 3 discs containing the [3-31-2001 Disco Biscuits](https://archive.org/details/db2001-03-31.shnf) show at the Fox Theatre in Boulder when I did some googling and realized most of the recordings I made were now available directly from the soundboard. My enthusiasm waned and I decided to put on one of the mixes I had in the box along with my live recordings. Ladies and gentlemen, I present the Mix of beautiful Sadness AND JOY Vol. 1. It was really great to listen to in order without looking at the track listing and quite the relief from the news for 66 minutes.
