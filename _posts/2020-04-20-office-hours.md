Over the past couple weeks one of the most rewarding activities has been calls with past colleagues, friends, and family. Connection is a key part of our psyche. With that Iâ€™ve decided to open up some [office hours](https://calendly.com/benreu/30min) to connect with more people during this time.

Founder looking for perspective? Coder struggling with a problem? Career or leadership question? Just want to connect with another human?
