Moved my Squarespace site to Jekyll. My writing is anemic so paying for it is silly. Moved the site to Github pages using Jekyll. 

Highlevel steps:

1. Exported the site into the Wordpress xml format
2. Used a [script I found](https://gist.github.com/spiffytech/e73777e167dc5a8b6a87) to do the initial extraction
3. Used ChatGPT to convert the HTML to Markdown 
4. Used ChatGPT to extract the image and video urls into a curl command to download
