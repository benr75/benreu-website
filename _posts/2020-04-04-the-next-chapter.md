*Wrote this Jan.1, 2020. Not sure why I didn’t post it but no better time than now to remind myself of these goals and share them.*

There is nothing more valuable than your time. Here are some of the broad strokes for how I plan to approach this new decade.

1. **Family**  
   I have two great boys and an amazing wife. The boys are 6 and 9, being present with them as they grow up is a number one priority.

2. **Learning**  
   I have been 100% focused on the strategy, design, development, and deployment of iOS and Android apps for the past decade. For the first part of 2020, I’ll be spending time researching topics that I care about, but have not put time into. Some are purely for personal enrichment like 🎸, while other topics I plan to research may result in a service/product/invention, something I can pour some valuable effort into. Information distribution, climate change, and family needs in the digital age are a couple to start.

3. **Building**  
   One thing I missed as my job went from software engineer to sales to culture was building things in code. In the last 6 months, I spent time working on a lot of quick turn prototypes and it was really enjoyable. I want to catch up on my framework of choice, Rails, and also try to understand some of the newer trends in development that I have prejudice for.

4. **Traveling, The Right Amount**  
   I love to travel. But for the past decade, it was too much travel. A majority of it was for work which meant less time with my family. I will travel in 2020, but not hit top tier status with travel providers and that is ok.

5. **Exercise**  
   🎿 🏄🏽‍♂️🚴🏼🤿
